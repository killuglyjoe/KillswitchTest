Test app for audience to Qt/C++ developer for Beetroot

DEscription taken from https://www.ovpn.com/en/faq/client/explanation-killswitch.

The OVPN client has a functionality called killswitch, which guarantees that no traffic becomes unencrypted if you should – at any point – lose the connection to OVPN.

If the connection to OVPN is lost, the killswitch will disable your Internet connection so no traffic is sent from you unencrypted.

The killswitch can be activated/inactivated from the Account tab in the client.
